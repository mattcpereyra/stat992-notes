# Number philosophy
my favorite number is 584309876259807239812.0239481464741.
also pi is pretty cool
zero is not a number, but people think it is. Does zero even exist?

Nah. 

# Useful commands
*git log --graph --pretty=oneline
*git checkout
*git checkout master
*git branch
# ex: `git branch bugfix`
# then `git branch` to print current branch
# (but just for the first time fill in the branchname)
*git push -u origin branchname
# origin is an alias for the `git@github.com...` ssh
